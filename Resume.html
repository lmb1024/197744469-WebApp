    <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm a student in University of the Cordilleras, under the College of Information Technology 
            and Computer Science, enrolled in the course of Bacheloor of Science in Information Technology 
            major in Web Technology. IT course was not my first choice when I entered college, in fact, 
            I graduated in Senior Highschool under the strand HUMSS and not ICT, which most of the IT students
            graduated from. I was enrolled first in BS Psychology then shifted to BA Behavioural Science before 
            I finally shifted to BS IT. I decided to shift to BSIT because I believe I can find more opportunities 
            in IT Industry in the future, but now, in my second year in this course, I'm already taking much
            more interest and already started to "love" it and not just finishing it for a brighter future.
